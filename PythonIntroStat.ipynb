    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook has two modes: **Command mode** and **Edit mode**. \n",
    "You can go into edit mode on an active notebook by hitting the **[Enter]** key, and you can go into command mode by hitting the **[esc]** key. \n",
    "This is reflected by the colour of the cell where you can enter code being blue (while in command mode) or green (while in edit mode). \n",
    "You can also just click the content of a cell to go into edit mode. \n",

    "In edit mode, you can alter the content of a cell, while command mode is used when running the content of the cell.\n",

    "### Markdown cells\n",
    "Cells can contain things other than code such as text with instructions or comments on the code, conclusions that you draw based on outputs, to-do lists, etc. \n",
    "You can use Jupyter Notebook to essentially write up a report whose results can be reproduced and checked by the reader; *reproducibility* of results is crucial for good science. \n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a way of creating formatted text using plain text. \n",
    "You can change the type of a cell to markdown by clicking the menu **[Cell]** and choosing **[Cell type]** and then **[Markdown]**. \n",

    "\n",
    "You can also add Latex code to a markdown cell by sandwiching it between \\$\\$. \n",
